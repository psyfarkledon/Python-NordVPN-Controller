# Python NordVPN Controller
Python Class that is used to connect to NordVPN and use its features including an option to connect to a random server. This works using command prompt commands in Windows. https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Windows/1350897482/Connect-to-NordVPN-app-on-Windows-using-the-Command-Prompt.htm

If your installation of NordVPN is located somewhere other than the default folder you will need to specify where the nordvpn.exe file is located. See example.py

Please report bugs, issues, crashes, or ideas. Anything is appreciated. Thank you! I may work on a MacOS and Linux version of this app in the future. If anyone is interested please feel free.
